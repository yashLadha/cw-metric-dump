## CW Metric Dump

This is a hobby project which i did for my own use. I was facing an issue with creating a csv or any format from `CW Dashboard`
or `aws` cli to get the metric data for a time range and statistic.

## Motivation

When I was trying to do some analysis on the traffic pattern for API's and the latency numbers, i couldn't able to find
a straightforward way to download the data offline and perform analysis on it. It requires downloading csv for each metric
and formatting the data.

## TODO
* [ ] Add examples and documentation
* [ ] Add Unit tests ðŸ˜…
